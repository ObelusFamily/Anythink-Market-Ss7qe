# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

## Installation

### Backend

First you need to have ruby version 2.7.0 installed on your system. Use `rbenv` to manage versions.
Next, you need to install bundler:

```
cd backend
gem install bundler
bundle
```

once it's done, run the backend with: `./start.sh`

### Frontend

You need to make you have `yarn` installed (more stuff here)


To start the app use: `yarn start`, it'll start both the backend and the frontend.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.
